# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-Interactive-Dashboard-using-MS-Excel-
I developed an interactive HR analytics dashboard in Excel to analyze employee demographics, salary distribution, performance trends, and departmental structure. The project involved data cleaning, transformation, KPI creation, and visualization using pivot tables, charts, and slicers to support data-driven HR decision-making.

🔹 Workflow

Reviewed the dataset for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Standardized data types and corrected formatting issues.

Created calculated fields such as age groups and salary bands.

Built pivot tables to answer each business question.

Designed charts and KPIs and combined them into a single interactive dashboard.

Added slicers for gender, department, performance, and salary band filtering.

🔹 Key Findings

The average employee age is 42 years, and the average salary is ₹78,159.

Higher salary bands are associated with stronger performance ratings.

Male employees hold a higher proportion of managerial roles compared to female employees.

The 35–44 and 45–49 age groups form the largest segments of the workforce.

Customer Support, Operations, and Sales departments have the highest employee counts.

Top performers earn significantly higher salaries across all salary bands.

🔹 Final Recommendation

Organizations should focus on improving gender diversity in leadership roles and create targeted development programs for high-performing employees in lower salary bands. Strategic workforce planning, salary benchmarking, and performance-based incentives can help enhance employee retention and productivity.
